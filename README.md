# Hello 👋
  My name is 💀Santiago💀 and in this repository we will do the Alkemy challenge, which proposes the following:
# Goal
  Develop an application for personal budget management. It must allow to create and edit income and expenses of money, and show a balance resulting from the
  registered operations.
  For the challenge to be completed, the following sections must exist:
## Home🏡
  The home screen should show the current balance, that is, the result of the income and expenses of money loaded, and a list of the last 10 registered.

  Status: Done✅

## Operations💲
  The application must contain:
  ### Operation registration form. It must contain:
    ○ Concept📝  
    ○ Amount💸  
    ○ Date📆  
    ○ Type (entry or exit)💲  
  ● List of operations registered according to their type (entry or expense).📃  
  ● From the list, it must be possible to modify or delete a registered operation🖊  
  ● previously. It must not be possible to modify the type of operation (entry or
    egress) once created.❌  
  
  Status: Done✅
  
Complying with the instructions, the challenge is finished, but additionally:

## User authentication 🙋‍♂️
  Add a registration and login form to identify the user who uses the
  application, and link the registered operations to the user authenticated in the system,
  both for listing and creating new records. The essential data to allow
  the entry must be an email and password, being able to add the ones you want.
  
  Status: Done✅
  
## Operation Categories📑
  Add the functionality to categorize the operations registered in the manager, such as
  For example, a category “food” to categorize expenses. Additionally, add the
  possibility of listing operations by category.
 
  Status: Done✅
  
  # How to put it to work?
  1. Download the repository.
  2. Do "npm install" on the frontend and backend folders.
  3. copy what is in "db.sql" and paste it (by right clicking) into the mysql shell.
  4. In 'Backend' create a dotenv file (Ex: '.env') 
  ### containing the following inside:
    ○ PORT = 3001  
    ○ SQLPASS = [your SQL password] 
    ○ SECRET = [What you want Ex: 'secret']
  5. Then just run the "npm start" command on both directories.
  6. Have fun.
  
## So... that's, let's code!
