  ### Operation registration form. It must contain:
    ○ Concept📝  
    ○ Amount💸  
    ○ Date📆  
    ○ Type (entry or exit)💲  
  ● List of operations registered according to their type (entry or expense).📃

Complying with the instructions, the challenge is finished, but additionally:

## User authentication 🙋‍♂️
  Add a registration and login form to identify the user who uses the
  application, and link the registered operations to the user authenticated in the system,
  both for listing and creating new records. The essential data to allow
  the entry must be an email and password, being able to add the ones you want.
